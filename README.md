## Moving Object Detection with the Fundamental Matrix 
---------
A very important principle in Computer Vision is that if we have two images of the same general area but at different angles we can compute a fundamental matrix.
This fundamental matrix is able to relate points between the two images with the epipolar constraint. 
If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(x_1, y_1) \text{and} (x_2, y_2) \text{correspond to the same point just in different images, then the relation is that" />
